The purpose of this program is to modernise the legacy program that was Big Earls stock control.
As well as generating a correct and normalised set of data for product display, the system will allow
for the modification of product descriptions.
It will:

1: Be able to remove ALL tagging from the system - This was placed in the DB originally due to ignorance and
the quickest possible way to stylaise the Zen Cart adverts that were used at the time.

2: Identify a product and correctly assign it to a table with the appropriate relationship with the specification tables

3: FTP to suppliers to retrieve newest prices.

4: Calculate daily prices and margins.
