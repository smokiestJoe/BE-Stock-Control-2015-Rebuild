The initial program was built adhoc, on a need by need basis. As a result, there was little to no modularisation,
very little reusable code, and extremely convoluted product databases.

This new program serves as a duel purpose, as the new stock control system (Modeling purposes only) and as a set of
utilities to detangle and clutter the previous data structure.

13.11.2018 - Product table for memory complete:
    Data has been detangled. A series of functions have been created to deal with the standardisation of
    product category and manufacturer throughout the detangling process.

    - PROTOTYPE MODELLING:
    - Data structure for product->memory provisionally completed.
    - Parent tables category and company complete, foreign keys assigned.
