Apparently, their creation was owing to a teleportation experiment that went wrong. First, a Laptop was teleported from A to B, next; a tablet. Curious scientists wondered what would happen if the two were teleported together and so, they attempted just that.<br><br>When they opened the teleportation chamber they found a perfectly fine looking Laptop, but no sign of the Tablet.  For days after the incident, the scientists used the laptop as they normally would without incident, however, it was not long before symptoms began to show.<br><br>The Scientists first became concerned about the Laptop when they observed a sudden and dramatic loss in weight. Going from nearly two kilograms in weight, this premium laptop now weighed less than a bag of sugar in only a few days. Despite this loss in mass, the device retained its performance capabilities. In some areas, displaying notable improvements.<br><br>\r\nAfter the weight-loss, the first signs of mutation began to appear. First off it was subtle little changes, the laptop had suddenly become responsive. It lasted longer on each charge, while curiously enough, taking less time to charge.\r\n<br><br>Then, physical mutation began to become apparent. The Laptop became sensitive to touch, specifically, on the screen. This negated the reliance on the physical keyboard, as the scientists could touch type on the newly formed On Screen Keyboard.<br><br>It was around this time the scientists began to suspect they had birthed a chimera. These suspicions were confirmed when they observed the hybrid bending over backwards, as well as forwards. Whilst unsettling to the eye at first, this new form factor positively improved the portable performance.<br><br>Once the mutation eventually stabilised, the result was a sight to behold. It had the lineage of a laptop, yet exhibited traits of a tablet. The scientists were unable to agree on appropriate nomenclature. Two polarised camps quickly formed around Tabtop and Laplet and fierce debate soon began.<br><br>To date, no resolution has been forthcoming. Fortunately, officials have stepped in and set guidelines for the interim period. An agreement was made that in lieu of compromise, or indeed a sensible suggestion, it would be known henceforth as a 2 in 1. <br><br>They are still made this way today.<br><br>Assuming we are to take <b>Grand Pappy Earl</b> at his word, of course.</p><span id = ''prodSpecs''>Product Information:</span><br><p><span id =''pinkRow''>Screen Size: </span>14"<br><span id =''blueRow''>Style: </span>Convertible<br><span id =''pinkRow''>CPU: </span>i5 6200U<br><span id =''blueRow''>RAM: </span>16GB<br><span id =''pinkRow''>Hard Disk: </span>256GB SSD<br><span id =''blueRow''>Graphics: </span>Intel HD 520 Integrated<br><span id =''pinkRow''>Resolution: </span>1920x1080<br><span id =''blueRow''>Wireless: </span>Yes 802.11: ac/a/b/g/n<br><span id =''pinkRow''>Battery: </span>Up to 8 Hour<br><span id =''blueRow''>Operating System: </span>Win 10<br><span id =''pinkRow''>USB Ports: </span>x3<br><span id =''blueRow''>Optical: </span>No<br><span id =''pinkRow''>Expansion: </span>Micro SD<br><span id =''blueRow''>Colour: </span>Black<br><span id =''pinkRow''>Weight: </span>1.8Kg<br><span id =''blueRow''>Dimensions: </span><span id = ''con_in''>H: 236 x W: 338 x D: 19mm</span><br><br><span id = ''warrantyInfo''>Warranty: </span>1 Year</p>', 'Computing', '2 in 1', '', 'ThinkPad Yoga 460', '2 In 1'),
